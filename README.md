It's here (without scrappers).  
Up to 3 printers may spawn on each stage.  

*Might still work* in multiplayer (untested), but if so the printer locations and items probably won't be synced.  

```
[Chances for amount and rarities]

0 printers  40 %        Common      62 %
1 printer   30 %        Uncommon    32 %
2 printers  20 %        Rare         3 %
3 printers  10 %        Boss         3 %
(Avg. 1 per stage)
```

You can disable hovering item names in its ImGui window.
